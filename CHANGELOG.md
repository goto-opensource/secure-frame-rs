# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-10-28

### Features

- [**breaking**] Update key derivation / tag computation to draft-03
The latest [changes in the draft](https://author-tools.ietf.org/diff?doc_1=draft-ietf-sframe-enc-01&doc_2=draft-ietf-sframe-enc-03) regarding the key derivation and tag computation, make theimplementation incompatible with previous versions

## [0.2.2] - 2023-08-02

### Features

- Aes ctr mode ciphers for openssl

## [0.2.1] - 2023-07-17

### Bug Fixes

- Wrong auth tag size

### Features

- Update to draft enc-01
- Add openssl crypto crate stub
- Implement hkdf with openssl
- Openssl aead implemenation
- Crypto library feature handling

## [0.2.0] - 2023-04-28

### Features

- Add Receiver::remove_encryption_key()
- Add FrameValidation in Receiver
- Impl from trait for KeyId
- Implement AesGcm128Sha256
- Allow configuring ciphersuite of sender and receiver
- Github actions

### Performance

- Set participant key in decrypt benchmark
- Avoid some allocation in extended header parsing
- Avoid some allocation in basic header parsing
- Improved nonce creation
- [**breaking**] Reusable, internal buffer in sender/receiver
decrypt requires receiver to be mutable.

The user is now responsible of copying data on subsequential encrypt/decrypt calls. E.g.
```rust
        let frame = sender
            .encrypt(&data, 0)?;
        let frame2 = sender
            .encrypt(&data2, 0)?;
// could be replaced with
        let frame = sender
            .encrypt(&data, 0)?
            .to_vec();
        let frame2 = sender
            .encrypt(&data2, 0)?;
```
