This library is an implementation of [draft-ietf-sframe-enc-latest](https://sframe-wg.github.io/sframe/draft-ietf-sframe-enc.html) and provides and end-to-end encryption mechanism for media frames that is suited for WebRTC conferences.
It is in it's current form a subset of the specification.
There is an alternative implementation under [goto-opensource/secure-frame-ts](https://github.com/goto-opensource/secure-frame-ts)

## Differences from the sframe draft
* Aes-CTR is not implemented
* ratcheting is not implemented
* keyIds are used as senderIds

## Supported crypto libraries
Currently two crypto libraries are supported:
- [ring](https://crates.io/crates/ring) 
    - is enabled per default with the feature `ring`
    - supports compilation to Wasm32
- [openssl](https://crates.io/crates/openssl)
    - is enabled with the feature `openssl`
        - To build e.g. use `cargo build --features openssl --no-default-features`
    - uses rust bindings to OpenSSL.
    - Per default the OpenSSL library is locally compiled and then statically linked. The build process requires a C compiler, `perl` (and `perl-core`), and `make`. For further options see the [openssl crate documentation](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.55/openssl/). 
    - Compilation to Wasm32 is [not yet supported](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/issues/1016)
